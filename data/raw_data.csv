d1,"Finding similar questions in large question and answer archives. There has recently been a significant increase in the number of community-based question and answer services on the Web where people answer other peoples' questions. These services rapidly build up large archives of questions and answers, and these archives are a valuable linguistic resource. One of the major tasks in a question and answer service is to find questions in the archive that a semantically similar to a user's question. This enables high quality answers from the archive to be retrieved and removes the time lag associatedwith a community-based system. In this paper, we discuss methods for question retrieval that are based on using the similarity between answers in the archive to estimate probabilities for a translation-based retrieval model. We show that with this model it is possible to find semantically similar questions with relatively little word overlap."
d2,"Evaluating Document Clustering for Interactive Information Retrieval. We consider the problem of organizing and browsing the top ranked portion of the documents returned by an information retrieval system. We study the effectiveness of a document organization in helping a user to locate the relevant material among the retrieved documents as quickly as possible. In this context we examine a set of clustering algorithms and experimentally show that a clustering of the retrieved documents can be significantly more effective than traditional ranked list approach. We also show that the clustering approach can be as effective as the interactive relevance feedback based on query expansion while retaining an important advantage -- it provides the user with a valuable sense of control over the feedback process."
d3,"Automatically classifying database workloads. The type of the workload on a database management system (DBMS) is a key consideration in tuning the system. Allocations for resources such as main memory can be very different depending on whether the workload type is Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) or Decision Support System (DSS). In this paper, we present an approach to automatically identifying a DBMS workload as either OLTP or DSS. We build a classification model based on the most significant workload characteristics that differentiate OLTP from DSS, and then use the model to identify any change in the workload type. We construct a workload classifier from the Browsing and Ordering profiles of the TPC-W benchmark. Experiments with an industry-supplied workload show that our classifier accurately identifies the mix of OLTP and DSS work within an application workload."
d4,"A new approach to intranet search based on information extraction. This paper is concerned with 'intranet search'. By intranet search, we mean searching for information on an intranet within an organization. We have found that search needs on an intranet can be categorized into types, through an analysis of survey results and an analysis of search log data. The types include searching for definitions, persons, experts, and homepages. Traditional information retrieval only focuses on search of relevant documents, but not on search of special types of information. We propose a new approach to intranet search in which we search for information in each of the special types, in addition to the traditional relevance search. Information extraction technologies can play key roles in such kind of 'search by type' approach, because we must first extract from the documents the necessary information in each type. We have developed an intranet search system called 'Information Desk'. In the system, we try to address the most important types of search first - finding term definitions, homepages of groups or topics, employees' personal information and experts on topics. For each type of search, we use information extraction technologies to extract, fuse, and summarize information in advance. The system is in operation on the intranet of Microsoft and receives accesses from about 500 employees per month. Feedbacks from users and system logs show that users consider the approach useful and the system can really help people to find information. This paper describes the architecture, features, component technologies, and evaluation results of the system."
